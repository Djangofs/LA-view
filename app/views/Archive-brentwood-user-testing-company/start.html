        Register a food business
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you start a new food business or take over an existing business, you must register with your local authority. You should do this at least <span class="bold-small">28 days</span> before trading or before food operations start.</p>
        <p>
          Your registration will be sent to the correct local authority based on your trading location.
        </p>
